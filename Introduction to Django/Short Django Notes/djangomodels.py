#1. Django Models
#i. What is a Model in Django?
# - A model is a Python class that defines the structure of your
#   database tables. Django automatically maps these models to actual
#   tables in the database using the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM).


#ii. What is an ORM?
# - An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) is a tool that allows you to
#   interact with a database using Python objects instead of raw SQL queries. 
#   Django provides a built-in ORM that is based on the popular SQLAlchemy library. 

#iii. What is a QuerySet?
# - A QuerySet is a collection of objects that are retrieved from a
#   database based on a set of conditions. QuerySets are used to perform
#   complex queries and operations on database data.
