# Sending/Passing Data to Template File

#1. Why Pass Data to Template?
# - Templates display content to the user (HTML pages).But HTML alone is static. 
#   You pass data from views.py to make your pages dynamic, like:
    # - Showing a user’s name
    # - Listing blog posts
    # - Displaying a success message after form submission

#2. The Basic Flow
# - View (Python code) ➡ passes data ➡ to Template (HTML with DTL)
