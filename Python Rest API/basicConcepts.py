# What is an API?
'''API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is like a waiter in a restaurant. You
(the client) ask for food (data), the waiter (API) takes your order to the kitchen (server), and brings you the food (response).'''
# APIs allow two applications to talk to each other. E.g. Your phone app sends a request to a weather server.

# What is a REST API?
